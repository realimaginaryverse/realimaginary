# realimaginary
Technologist inspired by Futurism, Innovation, Infinity and Time And Relative Dimension In Space.

My current main project is [The Real Imaginary Verse](https://opensea.io/collection/real-imaginary-verse)\
A surrealist digital alternate reality of self-similarity made of pure computational mathematics mimicking real-world phenomena, shimmering with intimations of infinity.

Follow me on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/RealImaginary), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RealImaginary42) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/realimaginaryverse) to get the latest from my art and learn more of my journey to the verse.
